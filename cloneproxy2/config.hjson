        #   - Send to clone (B-side) only if the target URL matches a pattern
        #       - Set MatchingRule to that pattern, e.g. "MatchingRule": "localhost"
        #   - Send to clone (B-side) only if the target URL does not match a pattern
        #       - Prefix '!' to the pattern, e.g. "MatchingRule": "!localhost"
